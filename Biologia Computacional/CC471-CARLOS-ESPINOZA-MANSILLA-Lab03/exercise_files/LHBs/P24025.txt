CC   -!- FUNCTION: The large envelope protein exists in two topological
CC       conformations, one which is termed 'external' or Le-HBsAg and the
CC       other 'internal' or Li-HBsAg. In its external conformation the
CC       protein attaches the virus to cell receptors and thereby
CC       initiating infection. This interaction determines the species
CC       specificity and liver tropism. This attachment induces virion
CC       internalization predominantly through caveolin-mediated
CC       endocytosis. The large envelope protein also assumes fusion
CC       between virion membrane and endosomal membrane (Probable). In its
CC       internal conformation the protein plays a role in virion
CC       morphogenesis and mediates the contact with the nucleocapsid like
CC       a matrix protein (By similarity).
CC   -!- FUNCTION: The middle envelope protein plays an important role in
CC       the budding of the virion. It is involved in the induction of
CC       budding in a nucleocapsid independent way. In this process the
CC       majority of envelope proteins bud to form subviral lipoprotein
CC       particles of 22 nm of diameter that do not contain a nucleocapsid
CC       (By similarity).
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: Li-HBsAg interacts with capsid protein and with HDV Large
CC       delta antigen. Isoform M associates with host chaperone CANX
CC       through its pre-S2 N glycan. This association may be essential for
CC       M proper secretion (By similarity).
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Virion membrane (By similarity).
CC   -!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
CC       Event=Alternative splicing, Alternative initiation; Named isoforms=3;
CC       Name=L; Synonyms=Large envelope protein, LHB, L-HBsAg;
CC         IsoId=P24025-1; Sequence=Displayed;
CC       Name=M; Synonyms=Middle envelope protein, MHB, M-HBsAg;
CC         IsoId=P24025-2; Sequence=VSP_031403;
CC       Name=S; Synonyms=Small envelope protein, SHB, S-HBsAg;
CC         IsoId=P24025-3; Sequence=VSP_031402;
CC   -!- DOMAIN: The large envelope protein is synthesized with the pre-S
CC       region at the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum and,
CC       hence will be within the virion after budding. Therefore the pre-S
CC       region is not N-glycosylated. Later a post-translational
CC       translocation of N-terminal pre-S and TM1 domains occur in about
CC       50% of proteins at the virion surface. These molecules change
CC       their topology by an unknown mechanism, resulting in exposure of
CC       pre-S region at virion surface. For isoform M in contrast, the
CC       pre-S2 region is translocated cotranslationally to the endoplasmic
CC       reticulum lumen and is N-glycosylated.
CC   -!- PTM: Isoform M is N-terminally acetylated at a ratio of 90%, and
CC       N-glycosylated at the pre-S2 region (By similarity).
CC   -!- PTM: Myristoylated (By similarity).
CC   -!- BIOTECHNOLOGY: Systematic vaccination of individuals at risk of
CC       exposure to the virus has been the main method of controlling the
CC       morbidity and mortality associated with hepatitis B. The first
CC       hepatitis B vaccine was manufactured by the purification and
CC       inactivation of HBsAg obtained from the plasma of chronic
CC       hepatitis B virus carriers. The vaccine is now produced by
CC       recombinant DNA techniques and expression of the S isoform in
CC       yeast cells. The pre-S region do not seem to induce strong enough
CC       antigenic response.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: Belongs to the orthohepadnavirus major surface antigen
CC       family.
