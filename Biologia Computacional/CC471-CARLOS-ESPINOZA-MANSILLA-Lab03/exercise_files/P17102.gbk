COMMENT     On Jul 5, 2005 this sequence version replaced gi:73622.
            [FUNCTION] Multifunctional protein that may modulate protein
            degradation pathways, apoptosis, transcription, signal
            transduction, cell cycle progress, and genetic stability by
            directly or indirectly interacting with hosts factors. Does not
            seem to be essential for HBV infection. May be directly involved in
            development of cirrhosis and liver cancer (hepatocellular
            carcinoma). Most of cytosolic activities involve modulation of
            cytosolic calcium. The effect on apoptosis is controversial
            depending on the cell types in which the studies have been
            conducted. By binding to human DDB1, may affect cell viability and
            stimulate genome replication. May induce apoptosis by localizing in
            mitochondria and causing loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.
            May also modulate apoptosis by binding human CFLAR, a key regulator
            of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Moderately
            stimulates transcription of many different viral and cellular
            transcription elements. Promoters and enhancers stimulated by HBx
            contain DNA binding sites for NF-kappa-B, AP-1, AP-2, c-EBP,
            ATF/CREB, or the calcium-activated factor NF-AT. May bind bZIP
            transcription factors like CREB1 (By similarity).
            [SUBUNIT] May form homodimer. May interact with human CEBPA, CFLAR,
            CREB1, DDB1, E4F1, HBXIP, HSPD1/HSP60, NFKBIA, POLR2E and SMAD4 (By
            similarity).
            [SUBCELLULAR LOCATION] Host cytoplasm. Host nucleus. Host
            mitochondrion. Note=Mainly cytoplasmic as only a fraction is
            detected in the nucleus. In cytoplasm, a minor fraction associates
            with mitochondria or proteasomes (By similarity).
            [SIMILARITY] Belongs to the orthohepadnavirus protein X family.
            [CAUTION] Transcriptional activities should be taken with a grain
            of salt. As of 2007, all studies demonstrating in vivo interaction
            between protein X and transcriptional components were performed
            with significant overexpression of both proteins and in the absence
            of viral infection.
